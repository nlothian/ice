TRUE,what is the relationship between income and smoking?,"Brunilda Casetta et al., 2016","Introduction
Previous evidence linked low socioeconomic status with higher smoking prevalence. Our objective was to assess the strength of this association in the world population, updating a previous work.


Methods
Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Subgroup analyses included continents, WHO regions, country mortality levels, gender, age, risk of bias, and study publication date. Independent reviewers selected studies, assessed potential bias and extracted data. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SOCINDEX, AFRICAN INDEX MEDICUS, and LILACS, and other sources from 1989 to 2013 reporting direct measurements of income and current cigarette smoking.


Results
We retrieved 13,583 articles and included 93 for meta-analysis. Median smoking prevalence was 17.8% (range 3-70%). Lower income was consistently associated with higher smoking prevalence (odds ratio [OR]: 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-1.56). This association was statistically significant in the subgroup analysis by WHO regions for the Americas (OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.42-1.68), South East Asia (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.00), Europe (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.29-1.63), and Western Pacific (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.02-1.72), and in studies conducted during 1990s (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.24-1.62) and 2000s (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.30-1.64). Likewise, it was noted in low-mortality countries (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.37-1.60) and for both genders. Prevalence was highest in the lowest income levels compared to the middle (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.49-1.92), followed by the middle level compared to the highest (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.20-1.43).


Conclusions
Our results show that current cigarette smoking was significantly associated with lower income worldwide and across subgroups, suggesting a dose-response relationship.


Implications
This unique updated systematic review shows a consistent inverse dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and income level, present among most geographical areas and country characteristics. Public health measures should take into account this potential inequity and consider special efforts directed to disadvantaged populations.","Studies worldwide show a consistent inverse dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and income level, present among most geographical areas and country characteristics.","M  Huisman et al., 2005","BACKGROUND
The aim of the study was to determine whether education or income was more strongly related to smoking in the European Union at large, and within the individual countries of the EU, at the end of the 1990s.


METHODS
We related smoking prevalence to education and income level by analyzing cross-sectional data on a total of 48,694 men and 52,618 women aged 16 and over from 11 countries of the European Union in 1998.


RESULTS
Both education and income were related to smoking within the European Union at large. After adjustment of the other socioeconomic indicator, education remained related to smoking in the EU at large, but income only remained so among men. Educational inequalities were larger than income-related inequalities among younger and middle-aged men and women. Educational inequalities were larger than income-related inequalities among men in all individual countries, and among women in Northern Europe. For women from Southern European countries, the magnitude of education- and income-related inequalities was similar.


CONCLUSIONS
Education is a strong predictor of smoking in Europe. Interventions should aim to prevent addiction to smoking among the lower educated, by price policies, school-based programs, and smoking cessation support for young adults.",Income and education are both related to smoking in the EU,"Ariel Esteban Bardach et al., 2016","Objective
Determine the relationship between tobacco-use prevalence and smoker income level in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).


Methods
A systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SOCINDEX, and LILACS databases. Studies from LAC published from January 1989 to December 2015 were included and were analyzed by subgroups disaggregated by decade of data, country, bias risk, sex, and age group.


Results
Of 1 254 studies evaluated by full text, 29 articles were included, of which 25 were chosen for meta-analysis. All included studies were cross-sectional or surveillance, primarily from Brazil and Mexico.Low income was associated with higher prevalence of active smoking (odds ratio [OR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.34-1.96) than high income (reference). A dose-response effect trend was observed: middle income (OR 1.23; 95%CI 1.00-1.52) and low income (OR 1.64; 95%CI 1.17-2.30). This association was greater in men (OR 2.22; 95%CI 1.77-2.78) than in women (OR 1.6; 95%CI 1.11-2.47).


Conclusions
An inverse relationship was observed between income and tobacco-use prevalence. Further efforts are required to determine this relationship in special populations, such as adolescents and pregnant women. This research can be useful for policymakers by improving tobacco control strategies and for characterizing public health equity issues.",There is an inverse relationship between income and smoking prevalence in studies from Latin America,"Mall  Leinsalu et al., 2011","BackgroundIn developed European countries in the last phase of the smoking epidemic, education is a stronger predictor of smoking than income or employment.

","Edesio  Alcobaça et al., 2020","Abstract Modern technologies demand the development of new glasses with unusual properties. Most of the previous developments occurred by slow, expensive trial-and-error approaches, which have produced a considerable amount of data over the past 100 years. By finding patterns in such types of data, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can extract useful knowledge, providing important insights into composition-property maps. A key step in glass composition design is to identify their physical-chemical properties, such as the glass transition temperature, Tg. In this paper, we investigate how different ML algorithms can be used to predict the Tg of glasses based on their chemical composition. For such, we used a dataset of 43,240 oxide glass compositions, each one with its assigned Tg. Besides, to assess the predictive performance obtained by ML algorithms, we investigated the possible gains by tuning the hyperparameters of these algorithms. The results show that the best ML algorithm for predicting Tg is the Random Forest (RF). One of the main challenges in this task is the prediction of extreme Tg values. To do this, we assessed the predictive performance of the investigated ML algorithms in three Tg intervals. For extreme Tg values ( ≤  450 K and  ≥  1150 K), the top-performing algorithm was the k-Nearest Neighbours, closely followed by RF. The induced RF model predicted extreme values of Tg with a Relative Deviation (RD) of 3.5% for glasses with high Tg ( ≥  1150 K), and RD of 7.5% for glasses with very low Tg ( ≤  450 K). Finally, we propose a new visual approach to explain what our RF model learned, highlighting the importance of each chemical element to obtain glasses with extreme Tg. This study can be easily expanded to predict other composition–property combinations and can advantageously replace empirical approaches for developing novel glasses with relevant properties and applications.","This paper accounts for Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that can extract useful knowledge, providing important insights into composition-property maps.

However, the redundancy of cytokine activities complicates the discovery of novel cytokines in this way, and the pleiotropic nature of many cytokines means that the principal activities of a new cytokine may bear little relation to that used for its isolation. We have adopted an alternative approach which relies on differential screening of an organized subtracted cDNA library from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using the inducibility of lymphokine messenger RNAs by anti-CD28 as a primary screening criterion. The ligation of the CD28 antigen on the T lymphocyte by a surface antigen, B7/BB-1, expressed on activated B lymphocytes and monocytes is a key step in the activation of T lymphocytes and the accumulation of lymphokine mRNAs. Here we report the discovery by molecular cloning of a new interleukin (interleukin-13 or IL-13) expressed in activated human T lymphocytes. Recombinant IL-13 protein inhibits inflammatory cytokine production induced by lipopolysaccharide in human peripheral blood monocytes. Moreover, it synergizes with IL-2 in regulating interferon-gamma synthesis in large granular lymphocytes.

From the perspective of health care and health information provision, this is both encouraging and unsettling; the demand indicates a clear direction for the development of future resources, but it also underscores the importance of processes ensuring access, reliability, and quality control. Objective This review provides an overview of current literature on pregnancy apps and aims at describing (1) the ways in which apps are used by women, in general, and by those of a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background; (2) the utility and quality of information provided; and (3) areas where more research, development, and oversight are needed. Methods We chose a narrative review methodology for the study and performed a structured literature search including studies published between 2012 and 2017. Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Studies were identified for inclusion using two separate search criteria and strategies: (1) studies on pregnancy apps and pregnant women’s use of these apps and (2) studies on CALD pregnant women and their use of technology for accessing information on and services for pregnancy. Overall, we selected 38 studies. Results We found that pregnancy apps were principally used to access pregnancy health and fetal development information. Data storage capability, Web-based features or personalized tools, and social media features were also popular app features sought by women. Lower rates of the pregnancy app uptake were indicated among lower-income and non-English-speaking women. Preliminary evidence indicates that a combination of technological, health literacy, and language issues may result in lower uptake of pregnancy apps by these groups; however, further investigation is required. A marked limitation of the health app industry is lack of regulation in a commercially dominated field, making it difficult for users to assess the reliability of the information being presented. Health professionals and users alike indicate that given the choice, they would prefer using pregnancy apps that are relevant to their local health care context and come from a trusted source. Evidence indicates a need for greater health professional and institutional engagement in the app development, as well as awareness of and guidance for women’s use of these resources. Conclusions This is the first review of pregnancy app use, types of information provided, and features preferred by pregnant women in general and by those of a CALD background in particular. It indicates the demand for access to accurate information that is relevant to users, their community, and their associated health services. Given the popularity of pregnancy apps, such apps have enormous potential to be used for the provision of accurate, evidence-based health information.","The paper aruges that pregnancy apps help pregnant women access health and fetal development information and store data.

Critics argue that many of the apps are inaccurate and lack evidence from either clinical trials or user experience. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the research literature on mHealth apps that track menstruation and fertility. Methods This project followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The ACM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for material published between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2019. Data summary and synthesis were used to chart and analyse the data. Results In total 654 records were reviewed. Subsequently, 135 duplicate records and 501 records that did not meet the inclusion criteria were removed. Eighteen records from 13 countries form the basis of this review. The papers reviewed cover a variety of disciplinary and methodological frameworks. Three main themes were identified: fertility and reproductive health tracking, pregnancy planning, and pregnancy prevention. Conclusions Motivations for fertility app use are varied, overlap and change over time, although women want apps that are accurate and evidence-based regardless of whether they are tracking their fertility, planning a pregnancy or using the app as a form of contraception. There is a lack of critical debate and engagement in the development, evaluation, usage and regulation of fertility and menstruation apps.

From the perspective of health care and health information provision, this is both encouraging and unsettling; the demand indicates a clear direction for the development of future resources, but it also underscores the importance of processes ensuring access, reliability, and quality control. Objective This review provides an overview of current literature on pregnancy apps and aims at describing (1) the ways in which apps are used by women, in general, and by those of a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background; (2) the utility and quality of information provided; and (3) areas where more research, development, and oversight are needed. Methods We chose a narrative review methodology for the study and performed a structured literature search including studies published between 2012 and 2017. Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Studies were identified for inclusion using two separate search criteria and strategies: (1) studies on pregnancy apps and pregnant women\u2019s use of these apps and (2) studies on CALD pregnant women and their use of technology for accessing information on and services for pregnancy. Overall, we selected 38 studies. Results We found that pregnancy apps were principally used to access pregnancy health and fetal development information. Data storage capability, Web-based features or personalized tools, and social media features were also popular app features sought by women. Lower rates of the pregnancy app uptake were indicated among lower-income and non-English-speaking women. Preliminary evidence indicates that a combination of technological, health literacy, and language issues may result in lower uptake of pregnancy apps by these groups; however, further investigation is required. A marked limitation of the health app industry is lack of regulation in a commercially dominated field, making it difficult for users to assess the reliability of the information being presented. Health professionals and users alike indicate that given the choice, they would prefer using pregnancy apps that are relevant to their local health care context and come from a trusted source. Evidence indicates a need for greater health professional and institutional engagement in the app development, as well as awareness of and guidance for women\u2019s use of these resources. Conclusions This is the first review of pregnancy app use, types of information provided, and features preferred by pregnant women in general and by those of a CALD background in particular. It indicates the demand for access to accurate information that is relevant to users, their community, and their associated health services. Given the popularity of pregnancy apps, such apps have enormous potential to be used for the provision of accurate, evidence-based health information."", ""year"": 2018}]",What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a pregnancy tracking app?,
TRUE,How does bullying of students with autism compare to bullying of students without disabilities?,"Chad A. Rose et al., 2015","Abstract. Students with disabilities are disproportionately represented within the bullying dynamic. However, few studies have investigated the interaction between disability identification and special education services. The current study evaluated bullying involvement (direct victimization, relational victimization, cybervictimization, bullying, fighting, relational perpetration) among 1,055 students with specific disabilities in inclusive and restrictive settings and their demographically matched (race, gender, grade) peers without disabilities. The results suggest that students with disabilities experience higher rates of victimization and engage in more fighting than students without disabilities. However, students with learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorders tended to report higher rates of victimization in inclusive environments, whereas students with intellectual disabilities and emotional and behavioral disorders reported higher rates of victimization in restrictive settings. Increased fighting was primarily associated with students identified with autism spectrum disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders, and other health impairments within restrictive environments.

The aim of this study was to assess female university students' knowledge of breast cancer and its preventative measures and to identify their main misconceptions regarding breast cancer.


METHODS
This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2011 and June 2012 and included female students from three large universities in Ajman, United Arab Emirates (UAE). A stratified random sampling procedure was used. Data were collected through a validated, pilot-tested, self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included 35 questions testing knowledge of risk factors, warning signs and methods for the early detection of breast cancer. Participants' opinions regarding breast cancer misconceptions were also sought.


RESULTS
The participants (n = 392) were most frequently between 18 and 22 years old (63.5%), non-Emirati (90.1%) and never married (89%). A family history of breast cancer was reported by 36 (9.2%) of the students.

TRUE,How high HbA1c affects hernia?,"Shingo Shimada et al., 2020","Background
Currently, the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide. However, the influence of DM or hyperglycemia on the outcome of resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear.


Methods
We analyzed 756 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy. These patients were assigned to an HbA1c ≥7.0% (H-A1c; n=100) or HbA1c <7.0% (L-A1c; n=656) group depending on their HbA1c level at admission. We investigated prognoses, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes including morbidities of HCC patients with high HbA1c, prognoses according to the treatment for DM were also investigated.


Results
Among all patients and those with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) did not differ significantly between the H-A1c and L-A1c groups. In contrast, the 5-year OS rate of the H-A1c group was 55% and that of the L-A1c group 71% among patients without HBV and HCV (NBNC patients) (P=0.03). Among NBNC patients, the median RFS of the H-A1c group was 13 months, and that of the L-A1c group was 26 months (P=0.02). In addition, metformin use was an independent favorable factor for both OS and RFS. The H-A1c group had significantly higher rates of hyperbilirubinemia, wound infection, and pneumonia.


Conclusions
HCC patients with high HbA1c might have poor prognoses for both survival and recurrence in NBNC-HCC. High HbA1c may also be a risk factor for morbidities after hepatectomy. Metformin use may constitute a good option for NBNC patients with HCC.",The paper is not relevant to the question. The paper is about how HbA1c affects hepatocellular carcinoma who undergo hepatectomies.,"R. Derr et al., 2003","OBJECTIVE
HbA(1c) is a standard clinical assessment of glycemia and the basis of most data relating glycemic control to complications. It remains unclear, however, whether HbA(1c) is affected by glycemic variation and mean glycemia.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
To test this question, we analyzed the statistical relationship between HbA(1c) levels and glycemic variability as measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). The records of 256 subjects were studied. SMBG data for the preceding 3 months were downloaded, and HbA(1c) was measured by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. Simple- and random-effects linear regression models were used to assess the independent contributions of mean blood glucose (BG) and SD of BG to HbA(1c), after adjusting for the mean BG.


RESULTS
Mean +/- SD for HbA(1c) was 7.66 +/- 1.11% and for BG was 8.5 +/- 1.9 mmol/l (153.3 +/- 34.9 mg/dl); SD of BG for individual subjects was 3.5 mmol/l (63.3 mg/dl), varying from 0.4 mmol/l (8.1 mg/dl; very stable glycemia) to 8.4 mmol/l (152.5 mg/dl; very unstable glycemia). A close correlation between mean BG and HbA(1c) was demonstrated (r = 0.62). Also, within-subject SD of BG correlated with HbA(1c) (r = 0.375), indicating that people with poorer glycemic control had higher BG variance. After adjusting for mean BG in a linear regression model, however, the effect of the within-subject SD of BG on the HbA(1c) was insignificant. Several further analyses confirmed the strength of the observation.

TRUE,At what daily dose does vitamin d3 hit diminishing returns?,"Patrick J. McCullough et al., 2019","Vitamin D3 is a secosteroid hormone produced in the skin in amounts estimated up to 25,000 international units (IUs) a day by the action of UVB radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol. Vitamin D deficiency is common due to both lack of adequate sun exposure to the skin, and because vitamin D is present in very few food sources. Deficiency is strongly linked to increased risk for a multitude of diseases, several of which have historically been shown to improve dramatically with either adequate UVB exposure to the skin, or to oral or topical supplementation with vitamin D. These diseases include asthma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, rickets and tuberculosis. All patients in our hospital have been routinely screened on admission for vitamin D deficiency since July 2011, and offered supplementation to either correct or prevent deficiency. During this time, we have admitted over 4700 patients, the vast majority of whom agreed to supplementation with either 5000 or 10,000 IUs/day. Due to disease concerns, a few agreed to larger amounts, ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 IUs/day. There have been no cases of vitamin D3 induced hypercalcemia or any adverse events attributable to vitamin D3 supplementation in any patient. Three patients with psoriasis showed marked clinical improvement in their skin using 20,000 to 50,000 IUs/day. Analysis of 777 recently tested patients (new and long-term) not on D3 revealed 28.7% with 25-hydroxyvitaminD3 (25OHD3) blood levels < 20 ng/ml, 64.1% < 30 ng/ml, a mean 25OHD3 level of 27.1 ng/ml, with a range from 4.9 to 74.8 ng/ml. Analysis of 418 inpatients on D3 long enough to develop 25OHD3 blood levels > 74.4 ng/ml showed a mean 25OHD3 level of 118.9 ng/ml, with a range from 74.4 to 384.8 ng/ml. The average serum calcium level in these 2 groups was 9.5 (no D3) vs 9.6 (D3), with ranges of 8.4 to 10.7 (no D3) vs 8.6 to 10.7 mg/dl (D3), after excluding patients with other causes of hypercalcemia. The average intact parathyroid hormone levels were 24.2 pg/ml (D3) vs. 30.2 pg/ml (no D3).

Methods: This open label, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial was performed during the spring and summer period enrolling adult subjects with 25OHD levels <20 ng/ml. In a sub-study presented here, subjects were randomized into two treatment groups using 30,0000 IU Vitamin D3 film coated tablets either in weekly (WD30K group, daily dose equivalent of 4286 IU/day) or a standard dose for maintenance treatment in a daily administration (SDD1K group, 1000 IU/day). Subjects in a control group received a similar 30,0000 IU Vitamin D3 film coated tablets in a once-per-month schedule (MD30K), dosing schedule for 12 weeks, (an equivalent to 1000 IU/day). The assessment of efficacy made by the changes in 25OHD and PTH levels in a throughout 12 weeks. Routine laboratory tests, serum and urinary calcium served for laboratory-safety assessments in every 4 weeks throughout the duration of the study. Results: The baseline values of 25OHD at in group (WD30K, SDD1K and MD30K) were in similar range: 13.7 ± 3.7 ng/mL, 13.48 ± 3.9 ng/mL and 13.1 ± 4.3 ng/mL, respectively. A daily dose of 1000 IU for 12 weeks was effective in restoration of 25OHD values to above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), however the median of the group failed to attain the 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) threshold. Dose-response was statistically different in the 4286 IU/day group compared to a 1000 IU/daily dose (p<0.001) for all study visits. Treatment efficiency assessed on two levels and for treatment duration of 8 and 12 weeks. The limit of 25 ng/mL was achieved by 95% of patients in 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk administration (vs. only 33% with 1000 IU/d) but more prominent difference observed with the limit of desired range (>30 ng/ml): 91% vs. 10% of subjects in after 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk and 1000 IU/d doses and 95% vs. 24% by end of the 12 weeks of treatment. The treatment-related increment potential was in a range of 2.26-2.92 ng/week for the weekly 30K dosing group compared to 1.32-1.70 ng/week for the 1000 IU/day standard maintenance dose group after 8 weeks. Treatment with 30,000 IU doses of Vitamin D3 in a weekly administration for 12 weeks did not abolish serum calcium levels. No difference in frequency of laboratory adverse events and other safety parameters was observed compared to lower maintenance doses or to control group. Conclusion: The safety of weekly loading oral doses of 30,000 IU vitamin D3 tablets was demonstrated and efficacy compared to the maintenance treatment with a daily dose equivalent of 1000 IU/d, in a daily or in monthly schedule in vitamin D deficient, adult population.

For all endpoints, levels in the deficient range (< 50 nmol/l; < 20 ng/ml) are associated with no benefit or adverse effects, while the most advantageous serum levels for 25(OH)D appeared to be close to 75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml).

Subjects in a control group received a similar 30,0000 IU Vitamin D3 film coated tablets in a once-per-month schedule (MD30K), dosing schedule for 12 weeks, (an equivalent to 1000 IU/day). The assessment of efficacy made by the changes in 25OHD and PTH levels in a throughout 12 weeks. Routine laboratory tests, serum and urinary calcium served for laboratory-safety assessments in every 4 weeks throughout the duration of the study. Results: The baseline values of 25OHD at in group (WD30K, SDD1K and MD30K) were in similar range: 13.7 \u00b1 3.7 ng/mL, 13.48 \u00b1 3.9 ng/mL and 13.1 \u00b1 4.3 ng/mL, respectively. A daily dose of 1000 IU for 12 weeks was effective in restoration of 25OHD values to above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), however the median of the group failed to attain the 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) threshold. Dose-response was statistically different in the 4286 IU/day group compared to a 1000 IU/daily dose (p<0.001) for all study visits. Treatment efficiency assessed on two levels and for treatment duration of 8 and 12 weeks. The limit of 25 ng/mL was achieved by 95% of patients in 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk administration (vs. only 33% with 1000 IU/d) but more prominent difference observed with the limit of desired range (>30 ng/ml): 91% vs. 10% of subjects in after 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk and 1000 IU/d doses and 95% vs. 24% by end of the 12 weeks of treatment. The treatment-related increment potential was in a range of 2.26-2.92 ng/week for the weekly 30K dosing group compared to 1.32-1.70 ng/week for the 1000 IU/day standard maintenance dose group after 8 weeks. Treatment with 30,000 IU doses of Vitamin D3 in a weekly administration for 12 weeks did not abolish serum calcium levels. No difference in frequency of laboratory adverse events and other safety parameters was observed compared to lower maintenance doses or to control group. Conclusion: The safety of weekly loading oral doses of 30,000 IU vitamin D3 tablets was demonstrated and efficacy compared to the maintenance treatment with a daily dose equivalent of 1000 IU/d, in a daily or in monthly schedule in vitamin D deficient, adult population.

TRUE,Does intermittent fasting improve artherosclerosis?,"Yuanli Chen et al., 2021","Atherosclerosis is a major pathology for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Clinically, the intermittent fasting (IF) has been observed to reduce the risk of CVDs. However, the effect of IF on the development of atherosclerosis has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we determined the protection of IF against high-fat diet–induced atherosclerosis in pro-atherogenic low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDLR-/-) mice and the potentially involved mechanisms. The LDLR-/- mice were scheduled intermittent fasting cycles of 3-day HFD feeding ad libitum and 1 day fasting, while the mice in the control group were continuously fed HFD. The treatment was lasted for 7 weeks (∼12 cycles) or 14 weeks (∼24 cycles). Associated with the reduced total HFD intake, IF substantially reduced lesions in the en face aorta and aortic root sinus. It also increased plaque stability by increasing the smooth muscle cell (SMC)/collagen content and fibrotic cap thickness while reducing macrophage accumulation and necrotic core areas. Mechanistically, IF reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Meanwhile, HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was attenuated by IF. Interestingly, circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes but not T cells and serum c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 levels were significantly reduced by IF. Functionally, adhesion of monocytes to the aortic endothelium was decreased by IF via inhibiting VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. Taken together, our study indicates that IF reduces atherosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice by reducing monocyte chemoattraction/adhesion and ameliorating hypercholesterolemia and suggests its potential application for atherosclerosis treatment.",The study concludes IF reduces atherosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice by reducing monocyte chemoattraction/adhesion and ameliorating hypercholesterolemia and suggests its potential application for atherosclerosis treatment.,"B.

Intermittent fasting reduces serum markers of oxidative stress, while nitric oxide levels may rise. Whether this translates into persistent improvements in endothelial function is unknown. The aim of the study was to address the effects of intermittent «Ramadan-type» fasting on endothelial function, nitric oxide bioavailability, biological parameters and blood pressure. Methods: We tested this hypothesis in fourteen healthy middle-aged male subjects, using a prospective casecontrolled study design. Microvascular endothelial function of skin vessels was evaluated with a laser Doppler imager, Before-fasting, after thirty days of fasting, and one month thereafter (Post-fasting). Endothelial dependent and independent dilatations were assessed by acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside iontophoresis, respectively. The hyperemic response to heating after a specific nitric oxide-synthase inhibitor L-N-arginine-methyl-ester administration, versus a saline solution, allowed further characterization of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. Blood pressure, body mass index, metabolic parameters were determined in all subjects. Results: Blood pressure decreased, while blood glucose and LDL-cholesterol increased during fasting (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Body mass index did not change. Hyperemic skin reactions assessed by acetylcholine increased during Fasting and Post-fasting, while sodium nitroprusside-induced hyperemia and nitric oxide-related vasodilation in response to heating increased during Fasting only (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Rises in serum triglycerides and blood urea nitrogen during fasting blunted nitric oxide-related vasodilation improvement upon heating (r=-0.55 and -0.60 respectively, p<0.05). These parameters did not change over time in thirteen matched controls. Conclusion: Intermittent fasting improved endothelial and non-endothelial dependent vasodilations and decreased blood pressure.

We hypothesized that IF improves blood pressure and lipid profiles due to a less activated local RAS in the left ventricle of mice, irrespective of the dietary scheme. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intermittent fasting on cardiovascular parameters and local RAS in the left ventricle (LV) of mice fed either a high-fat (HF) or high-fructose diet (HFru). Metabolic alterations were induced in C57BL/6 mice by providing them free access to a high-fat or a high-fructose (HFru) diet for 8 weeks. Following the 8-week metabolic alteration period, the mice were subjected to the IF protocol in which mice were deprived of food for 24 hours, every other day, for a period of 4 weeks. The IF protocol caused significant reduction in body weight, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels, in addition to augmenting the plasma and urinary uric acid levels, irrespective of the diet. Post IF protocol, beneficial LV remodeling was observed in animals fed either diet and included reduced LV mass, thickness, and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. These results comply with the improved RAS modulation, which favored ACE2/MAS receptor axis over the renin/ACE/AT1 axis. In conclusion, the significant decrease in weight brought about as a result of the IF protocol lead to modulation of the local RAS, with the consequential benefit of LV remodeling and reduction in blood pressure, irrespective of the diet.","The paper is indirectly relevant to the question.

The treatment was lasted for 7 weeks (\u223c12 cycles) or 14 weeks (\u223c24 cycles). Associated with the reduced total HFD intake, IF substantially reduced lesions in the en face aorta and aortic root sinus. It also increased plaque stability by increasing the smooth muscle cell (SMC)/collagen content and fibrotic cap thickness while reducing macrophage accumulation and necrotic core areas. Mechanistically, IF reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Meanwhile, HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was attenuated by IF. Interestingly, circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes but not T cells and serum c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 levels were significantly reduced by IF. Functionally, adhesion of monocytes to the aortic endothelium was decreased by IF via inhibiting VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression.

Intermittent fasting reduces serum markers of oxidative stress, while nitric oxide levels may rise. Whether this translates into persistent improvements in endothelial function is unknown. The aim of the study was to address the effects of intermittent \u00abRamadan-type\u00bb fasting on endothelial function, nitric oxide bioavailability, biological parameters and blood pressure. Methods: We tested this hypothesis in fourteen healthy middle-aged male subjects, using a prospective casecontrolled study design. Microvascular endothelial function of skin vessels was evaluated with a laser Doppler imager, Before-fasting, after thirty days of fasting, and one month thereafter (Post-fasting). Endothelial dependent and independent dilatations were assessed by acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside iontophoresis, respectively. The hyperemic response to heating after a specific nitric oxide-synthase inhibitor L-N-arginine-methyl-ester administration, versus a saline solution, allowed further characterization of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. Blood pressure, body mass index, metabolic parameters were determined in all subjects. Results: Blood pressure decreased, while blood glucose and LDL-cholesterol increased during fasting (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Body mass index did not change. Hyperemic skin reactions assessed by acetylcholine increased during Fasting and Post-fasting, while sodium nitroprusside-induced hyperemia and nitric oxide-related vasodilation in response to heating increased during Fasting only (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Rises in serum triglycerides and blood urea nitrogen during fasting blunted nitric oxide-related vasodilation improvement upon heating (r=-0.55 and -0.60 respectively, p<0.05). These parameters did not change over time in thirteen matched controls. Conclusion: Intermittent fasting improved endothelial and non-endothelial dependent vasodilations and decreased blood pressure.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intermittent fasting on cardiovascular parameters and local RAS in the left ventricle (LV) of mice fed either a high-fat (HF) or high-fructose diet (HFru). Metabolic alterations were induced in C57BL/6 mice by providing them free access to a high-fat or a high-fructose (HFru) diet for 8 weeks. Following the 8-week metabolic alteration period, the mice were subjected to the IF protocol in which mice were deprived of food for 24 hours, every other day, for a period of 4 weeks. The IF protocol caused significant reduction in body weight, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels, in addition to augmenting the plasma and urinary uric acid levels, irrespective of the diet. Post IF protocol, beneficial LV remodeling was observed in animals fed either diet and included reduced LV mass, thickness, and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. These results comply with the improved RAS modulation, which favored ACE2/MAS receptor axis over the renin/ACE/AT1 axis. In conclusion, the significant decrease in weight brought about as a result of the IF protocol lead to modulation of the local RAS, with the consequential benefit of LV remodeling and reduction in blood pressure, irrespective of the diet."", ""year"": 2019}]",Does intermittent fasting improve artherosclerosis?,

Literature has shown that physical activity is genetically regulated; however there is limited information on the mechanisms that influence this process with existing studies primarily focused on genomic and/or transcription association studies. There have been no studies to determine differential protein expression in the nucleus accumbens, the brain site thought to be involved in activity regulation, between high and low active animals. We compared the global nucleus accumbens proteome signature from known high- and low-active mice and identified seven differentially expressed proteins. Low active mice generally over expressed proteins associated with neural stress (Stress 70 protein and V type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A), and the high-active mice over expressed proteins associated with metabolism (creatine kinase B, succinyl-CoA ligase). Previously suggested mechanisms associated with activity regulation in the nucleus accumbens have centered on dopamine receptor 1 and endocannabinoid receptor 1. However, these proteins and the associated pathways were not differentially expressed between high and low active mice. In conclusion, protein expression must be determined as part of the effort to identify involved mechanisms in regulating activity and there appears to be separate nucleus accumbens proteome signatures associated with high- and low-active mice.","This paper asserts that there have been no studies to determine differential protein expression in the nucleus accumbens, the brain site thought to be involved in activity regulation, between high and low active animals.

Smoking in the workplace is particularly concerning. Smoking-free workplaces decrease the risk of exposure of non-smoking personnel to cigarette smoke. Recent studies have mostly focused on the effect of daily or non-occupational stressors (in comparison with occupational stress) on prevalence of smoking. Occupational stress is often evaluated in workplaces for smoking cessation or control programs, but the role of non-occupational stressors is often disregarded in this respect. Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in an automobile manufacturing company. The response of automotive industry workers to parts of the validated, reliable, Farsi version of Musculoskeletal Intervention Center (MUSIC)-Norrtalje questionnaire was evaluated. A total of 3,536 factory workers participated in this study. Data were analyzed using SPSS and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The correlation of smoking with demographic factors, occupational stressors and life events was evaluated. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that even after adjusting for the confounding factors, cigarette smoking was significantly correlated with age, sex, level of education, job control and life events (P<0.05). Conclusion The results showed that of occupational and non-occupational stressors, only job control was correlated with cigarette smoking. Non-occupational stressors had greater effect on cigarette smoking. Consideration of both non-occupational and occupational stressors can enhance the success of smoking control programs. On the other hand, a combination of smoking control and stress (occupational and non-occupational) control programs can be more effective than smoking cessation interventions alone.",This paper explains that smoking in the workplace is particularly concerning as smoking-free workplaces decrease the risk of exposure of non-smoking personnel to cigarette smoke.,"L.

Our country has many ethnic minorities and has a unique national costume culture, which provides rich resources for the art design of ethnic costumes. This paper uses artificial intelligence technology and Internet of Things technology to design a national costume element library system. In this system, users can match national costume suits according to their own preferences, and they can also transmit national culture to people through this system. After the system is designed, the system performance is optimized by interactive algorithms, and the availability of the system is verified by testing system security, stress resistance, concurrency, etc. Through the verification of the system designed in this paper, the national costumes designed by innovative technology can be copied in batches, which enhances the innovation of national costume design in our country and has high production efficiency. It is finally proved that the design results of this paper meet the design requirements."", ""year"": 2022}, {""title"": ""Designing Interactive Costumes: Challenges and Prospects to Integrate Computational Clothing in the Performing Arts"", ""authors"": [""Michaela Honauer""], ""abstract"": ""This is the abstract of my PhD research focusing on smart costuming and its production processes for theatre, ballet, or related cultural stage performances."", ""year"": 2017}]",How can AI be used in theater costume design?,
